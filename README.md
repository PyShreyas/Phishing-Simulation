# Cybersecurity Awareness Project: Mock Phishing Campaign

## Objective
This project was developed as part of a cybersecurity minor project to simulate a **mock phishing campaign** inside a dummy organization. The goal is to educate employees about how phishing attacks work, how they appear, and how to identify and report them.

## Purpose
With phishing being one of the most common and successful attack vectors used by cybercriminals, it is essential to raise awareness among employees in any organization. This project helps simulate a real-world phishing scenario and track responses without any harm.

## Dummy Organization Structure
We targeted a **mock company** with the following departments:
- Technical Team (15 employees)
- Software Development Team (20 employees)
- Human Resources (10 employees)
- Finance and Admin (10 employees)

Total Employees Simulated: **55**
